Hi, my name is Kate Chandler and I am a facilitator at UBC FIREtalks.  Twice per semester, UBC FIREtalks hosts an interdisciplinary gathering of graduate students.  During this event, six graduate students make a five-minute presentation on their work, with plenty of time for discussion. 

The theme of the FIREtalk for February 24th is 'GIS and Data Visualization' and we're looking for students do presentations.  I personally really enjoy FIREtalks because the interdisciplinary nature of the event means people get new ideas, which always makes for a very exciting atmosphere.  It's also a supportive environment for those who want to try new ways of presenting - presenters can opt to do a ten-minute activity instead of a five-minute talk. 

The event takes place in room 216 in Koerner Library, 4 - 6 pm Februrary 24th.  If anyone is interested in presenting, please contact me by Friday February 19th.  My email is kate.chandler@ubc.ca.
